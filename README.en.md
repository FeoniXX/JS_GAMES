# JS - special effects - Games Collection

```
I have been doing web development for many years, mainly in the back end and front end.
I used to see front ends that could write special effects and games.
I envy it.

Recently, I took time to study the front-end knowledge carefully and began to write some small games for hands-on training.
In fact, there is no difference between writing games and ordinary projects.
It's just interface, object-oriented, algorithm, design pattern.
But the game is more difficult because the user experience is very demanding.

Here are some special effects and games I've written recently.
